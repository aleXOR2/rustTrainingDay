Question 2

Determine whether the program will pass the compiler. If it passes, write the expected output of the program if it were executed.

fn main() {

  let mut s = String::from("hello");

  for &item in s.as_bytes().iter() {

    if item == b'l' {

      s.push_str(" world");

    }

  }

  println!("{s}");

}

You answered:

This program does compile.

The output of this program will be:

"Hello world"

The correct answer is:

This program does not compile.

Context: Because s.as_bytes() produces an immutable reference to s, it is illegal to mutate s (via push_str) inside the for-loop.
